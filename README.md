# Dice Demonstration

### Project Overview
This will become a demonstration to use during presentations with a live audience using their phones to participate.  A host will control the metrics of the game, and control a private key that will contain sone Eth the users are trying to win. The host determines how many dice can be rolled and what rolling mode the users will be using.  The users will try to roll their dice to match the hosts.  If they do, some of the prize money is sent to them along with a winning message.  Eventually the hosts number will have too many characters (dice) for the users to be able to match.  This will show the security of a 64 character private key.
